# **Netpune-Balls**

Neptune-Balls is an Open Source tool created within the framework the Project **Rolling in the deep: Neptune balls as plastic sentinels**

## About This Project

Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems. Seagrass beds have been recognized as natural sinks for plastics, while Neptune balls are efficient particle traps. This pilot study seeks to explore the potential of these spherical structures as sentinels for plastic pollution along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea by analyzing their entrapment capability. We aim to introduce an innovative approach to assessing plastic pollution in marine ecosystems.

### What is the context of this research?

Plastic pollution is a global threat to both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. [Approximately 0.5% of plastic waste enters the oceans](https://ourworldindata.org/how-much-plastic-waste-ends-up-in-the-ocean), with [a staggering 400.3 Million metric tons produced worldwide in 2022](https://plasticseurope.org/knowledge-hub/plastics-the-fast-facts-2023/). Within marine ecosystems, [plastic accumulates on the seafloor or drifts across the sea](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3). Some ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows act as a sink for these pollutants creating islands of pollution. Additionally, Neptune balls, spherical structures formed by dead leaves, detritus, and sediment within seagrass meadows, act as traps for plastic particles. Recent studies indicate that these [balls can hold up to 1,470 items/Kg](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79370-3). Surprisingly, the correlation between Neptune balls and plastic contamination in the same area remains unexplored.

### What is the significance of this project?

The significance of this project lies in its potential to address the pressing issue of plastic pollution in marine ecosystems. By investigating the entrapment capability of Neptune balls and their correlation with plastic contamination, we aim to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of plastic pollution in coastal areas. This research not only enhances our understanding of the sources and distribution of plastic waste but also offers practical implications for monitoring and mitigating its impact on marine environments. Ultimately, our findings could inform policymakers, researchers, and communities about effective strategies for preserving marine biodiversity and safeguarding coastal ecosystems for future generations.

### What are the goals of the project?

This pilot research aims to explore the potential of Neptune balls as sentinels for plastic pollution along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. For the first time, an integrated approach, based on analyzing the plastic entrapment capability of the spheres and the levels of plastic contamination in the same areas, will be applied.\

Specific aims are:\
1. Identifying hotspot areas for Neptune balls collection in the Mediterranean Sea\
2. Improving microplastic extraction protocols from Neptune balls\
3. Detecting plastic contamination in beach sediment within the study areas\
4. Investigating the correlation between Neptune balls and plastic contamination\
5. Developing standardized protocols\
6. Starting a campaign to promote the reuse and recycling of seagrass fibers.

Hotspots along the Mediterranean coasts rich in Neptune Balls and plastic contamination will be identified. Samples will then be collected and sent to us by local researchers. Plastic extraction will be conducted on Neptune Balls and beach sediment to discern patterns and correlations with the pollution of the area. Weâ€™ll synthesize the results using an interactive webpage and standardized protocols, significantly contributing to understanding and managing plastic pollution in marine ecosystems.

## Additional Information

An interactive webpage will be developed to streamline the collection and dissemination of information regarding Neptune Balls collection and plastic contamination in the study area. This webpage will serve as a centralized platform where data collected from fieldwork, including Neptune Balls collection locations and plastic contamination levels, will be compiled and displayed in real time. Researchers will have the opportunity to interact directly with the data, enabling them to visualize and analyze findings effortlessly. Additionally, the webpage will feature user-friendly tools that allow users to conduct simple analyses, empowering them to draw insights and contribute to the ongoing research. This interactive platform not only enhances transparency and accessibility but also encourages active engagement and collaboration among researchers, stakeholders, and the wider community in addressing plastic pollution in marine ecosystems.

Neptune Balls are composed of fibers formed by dead leaves and detritus mixed with sediment. A campaign to raise awareness about the potential use of Neptune Balls fibers as a sustainable resource for producing biodegradable alternatives to traditional plastics will be started. It may involve educational initiatives to inform the public about the environmental benefits of using biodegradable materials and the importance of recycling Neptune ball fibers. Additionally, the campaign could promote collaboration with relevant industries and stakeholders to explore innovative methods for processing Neptune ball fibers and integrating them into biodegradable plastic or resin production processes.
